## A new type of worm
My friend and I have come across a new type of internet worm that leverages social media to download a fake game in order to takeover accounts to spread the virus to others. I will do a full write up soon.\

## Time
After a while, I never managed to get a update from both cloud providers (EDG.IO/AKAMAI). The malware would embed deep into the OS like a rootkit, isn't identifiable by most AV's, and looks for any sort of information, logins, or financial details it can use to give to the hackers to have a spree with. This malware has full control of the victim's PC, and is something you have to reinstall to get rid of.
