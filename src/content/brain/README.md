This place is filled with my notes that I took while I'm studying, if you want to check them out, then feel free to do so. 
## How to read

If you are in my website already, use the sidebar to navigate through the notes. You might as well use the search bar to find something specific. If you are in GitHub, you can use the file tree of the repository to navigate through the notes.

Have a good read!
